Guardian: A Machine Learning-Based Anti-Phishing Browser Extension

## Objective
This project aims to train machine learning models and deep neural nets on a dataset created to predict phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites are gathered to form a dataset and required URL and website content-based features are extracted. The performance level of each model is measured and compared.

## Research Problem
Anti-phishing browser extensions developed to detect and prevent phishing attacks, there is still a lack of understanding of their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This poses a significant problem for individuals and organizations that rely on such technology to protect themselves from phishing attacks

## Research Objective
1.	Identify the types of phishing attacks that anti-phishing frameworks are most effective in detecting and preventing.
2.	Determine the factors that affect the effectiveness of anti-phishing frameworks in detecting and preventing phishing attacks.
3.	Evaluate the performance of anti-phishing browser frameworks in detecting and preventing different types of phishing attacks, such as email phishing, spear phishing, smishing, vishing, clone phishing, and whaling.
4.	Identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing anti-phishing browser frameworks and develop a effective browser extension,
